## Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.


## Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
I started my hyperparameters with the base values from Sebastian's lecture, they didn't seem to be doing the best with a throttle speed of just 0.5, so I reduced the throttle speed to see if that would help, and it didn't. It was still turning very dramatically all the way left or right. I continued adjusting my PID parameters to not much avail. I looked into the forums and saw suggestions from other students, I noticed that my `P` parameter was fairly close but `I` was pretty far off and `D` was ok, but not very close. Trying some other numbers near the suggestions, helped a bit, but not as significant as implementing the `speedPid` controller. I decided to try it because back when we did the behavioral cloning assignment, I spent hours and hours trying to fine tune my data set, but ultimately, once I added an additional suggested piece, it worked many times better. The `speedPid` controller helped significantly because it would slow down enough when the `cte` got crazy. Overall, if I did it again (and had more time) I would implement the twiddle or SGD algorithm to help speed up the overall hyperparameter tuning.
